Now that you have your course trailer ready to be shared and viewed, the next step will be to make it visible on your Canvas site.

There are a couple ways you can approach this, and this page will guide you on the steps for uploading a video directly to the home page of your Canvas site. As well, [here is a short video walk-through that tackles this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCPOluFAoYA&feature=youtu.be).   

* Head to the home tab of your Canvas site, and select the "Edit" icon
