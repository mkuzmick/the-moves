Adobe's Premiere Pro is an amazingly powerful platform for video editing on mac OS and Windows computers. And while it can be a little bit daunting when getting started with the program, it doesn't have to be!

We have two videos below that will -- **in less than 10 minutes** -- guide you from the first step of creating a new project, all the way through the final step of exporting your final sequence as a video file that you can then share with the world.

This first video will tackle:
* Creating a new project
* Importing media
* Creating a timeline from media
* Resizing, moving, and manipulating media on the canvas
* Importing audio
* Trimming clips
* Making cuts using the razor tool
* Trimming clips via the Source panel
* Applying video transitions
* Adding text to the timeline
* Editing formatting of text
* Retiming video clips
* Creating freeze frames from your videos

And once all of your editing work is complete, you may be wondering how to export your sequence in a format that is shareable and up-loadable to Youtube, Vimeo, Google Drive, Canvas, etc. This second video will walk you through that. Good luck!
