# Trimming a video using Quicktime or the native Photos app on Windows 10

Trimming the beginning or end of a video is very easy to do on either a PC or a Mac, using applications that are likely already installed on your machine. Here is how to do it.

If you recorded through Zoom, first you'll need to download your video from Canvas:

  * Click on "Zoom"
  * Click on "Cloud Recordings"
  * Click on the correct recording
  * Click the "Download" icon associated with that file

## Trimming on a Mac using Quicktime Player

  * Now that the file is trimmed, it's ready to export:
    * "File" > "Export As" > "1080p" (or desired resolution)

## Trimming on a PC using the native Photos app

[Here is a video walk-through of this process](https://youtu.be/YSzQhaUwvUo)

  * This will give two handles at the beginning and end of the video. You can drag these to where you’d ideally like the video to start and end.

## Editing out a section from the middle of your video

In addition to being able to trim your video from the beginning and end, there may be instances when you want to edit out a small section from the middle of your video. This can also be done very easily in Quicktime Player, and [here is a quick video walkthrough on how to do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1wm4khPOQI&feature=youtu.be)
