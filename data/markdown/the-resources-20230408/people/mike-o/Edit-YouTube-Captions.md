# Editing Auto-Generated Captions in Youtube Videos

Youtube does a fairly decent job of automatically generating captions for videos that are uploaded to Youtube. However, it is not perfect!

For example, punctuation (e.g., commas, periods, etc.) and the spelling of proper nouns (e.g., Bok Center, not Box Center!!!) are areas where it struggles.

Should you need to go in and adjust the captions that Youtube automatically generates for the videos that you upload, then this tutorial will be able to help.
