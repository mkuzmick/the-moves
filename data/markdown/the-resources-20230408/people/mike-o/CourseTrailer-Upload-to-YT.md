Now that you have your course trailer ready to be shared and viewed, the next step will be to make it visible on your Canvas site.

There are a couple ways you can do this, but we are recommending that you upload your video to the Youtube page associated with your g.harvard.edu account, and then embed that video onto your Canvas page. This will then apply Youtube's auto-captioning functionality, which will help those with accessibility issues.

This may sound daunting (but it is not hard!), and we will walk you through the steps of that process.

## Uploading your trailer to Youtube

  * While logged into your g.harvard.edu account, navigate to the Youtube app

  * The video should now be visible, and note that the captions (CC icon) are now viewable as well inside Canvas

## If you would like to directly upload to Canvas, [here is a walkthrough of how to do that](http://resources.learninglab.xyz/simple/people/mike-o/CourseTrailer-DirectUpload-Canvas)

  * (NOTE, however, that this will not incorporate captions in your video!)
