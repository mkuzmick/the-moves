## My bio:
I plan and coordinate Learning Lab operations, identify areas for programmatic improvement, and develop solutions that allow the LL community to work more efficiently. Right now I'm learning Github, markdown, and am basically dancing around actually learning how to code. (:
I have a BA in Geology from Vassar College and before coming to the LL I spent time in graduate school and then 5 years as an exhibit developer at the Museum of Science, Boston. I love learning and helping teams make amazing things together.
In my spare time I take classes in Strategic Management at Harvard Extension.
