#### About Me

Hi! My name is Sarah and I am a first-year at Harvard College. My journey at the Learnng Lab began in January 2020 and it has been an amazing experience so far! My early days at the Lab involved work with cameras and editing footage we filmed in the studio on Final Cut Pro, which was fantastic as I've always had a passion for film, and I hope to expand this work to making more involved projects. Right now, as we are all scattered across the world, LLUFs are working toward improving remote and online education. This period has been so formative for me as I rethink everything about how I learn personally and how other students learn, in addition to education at various levels (higher education vs. secondary and primary education) and education in various forms (i.e. in the classroom, personal projects, professional experiences, etc.). I feel that the Learning Lab is doing incredibly important work as we lead the Harvard community in discovering revolutionary ways to keep students engaged and actively learning and innovating. I feel that we are putting our passions and creativity to use in the best way and I'm excited to see where we end up!
