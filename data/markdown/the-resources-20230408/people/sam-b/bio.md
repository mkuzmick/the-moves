## My bio:
I am a current senior at Harvard studying Linguistics.  When on campus, I lived in Leverett House!  I grew up in the small ski town of Whitefish, Montana, where I learned to love the hiking, swimming, picking wild berries, and generally anythin to do with being outdoors.  I have been a LLUF since almost the first day I stepped on campus in September of 2016.  At the Learning Lab, I've focused on working with GarageBand and other music/podcast creation and compliation software and exploring how that type of activity can be beneficial in classroom settings; I've worked with icebreaker games, which I think are a valuable tool for small classes that need to create relationships among students - a tool that should be used better; I have also spent time thinking about other analogies between the classroom and other spaces, such as a gaming space or a musical space, because these comparisons can give us great insight into building a good learning environment by using the tools that create buy-in, excitement, learning, mastery, and so on from those other environments.  After graduation, I will be completing a Fulbright fellowship to teach English in the Czech Republic before moving more permanently to that country to work in Prague.
