    <p>This <a href="https://github.com/learninglab-dev/ll_secondReactTutorial/blob/master/walkthrough.md">tutorial</a>, teaching users how to make API calls in React, was created by Sophie B with the help of Lauren to follow the first reactLab tutorial. After finishing the tutorial, you'll have an app in which you can search a keyword and generate a GIF from GIPHY!</p>
