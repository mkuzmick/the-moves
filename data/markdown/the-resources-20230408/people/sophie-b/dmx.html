    <h1>DMX Machine</h1>
    <h2>by Casey and Lauren, 2019 Fall</h2>
    <p>Casey and Lauren worked on some early prototypes in the Fall of controlling DMX lights via a node.js app. They connected the lights directly to a laptop via a usb to DMX converter and were able to turn on lights, change their colors, and even do a few animated patterns via the command line. They also experimented a bit with different types of input to the node app. For example, they connected a MIDI grid controller and sent the inputs from that to the node app.</p>
