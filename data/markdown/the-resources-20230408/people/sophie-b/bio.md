## My Bio
My name is Sophie, and I'm a junior in Cabot House pursuing a concentration in History & Literature, secondary concentration in Government, and language citation in Mandarin Chinese. I became a LLUF in March of 2018 in large part because I wanted to develop technical skills like coding and graphic design, because I mostly only work in the humanities and social sciences both in class and beyond. This interest ultimately snowballed into my coding journey here at the Lab! This semester, I mostly work with reactLab, creating resources like webpages and tutorials for the Bok Center but in the past, I've worked with codeLab, musicLab, theaterLab, and many others. Being a LLUF has by far been one of the best experiences of my college career. <3
