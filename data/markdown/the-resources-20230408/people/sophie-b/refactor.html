    <h1>React Refactoring</h1>
    <h2>by reactLab, 2020 Spring</h2>
    <p>In order to get Firebase working on our Video Interactions app, reactLab had to spend a good amount of time figuring out how to refactor old React (which was featured in many React/Firebase tutorials that we found) using React Hooks. This kept our Firebase code in sync with the rest of our code in terms of structure and methods!</p>
