    <h1>the-resources on GitHub</h1>
    <h2>by the LL, 2020 Spring</h2>
    <p>When we were moved off campus, the LL needed a way to collaborate on, create, and publish resources remotely. That became <a href="https://github.com/learninglab-dev/the-resources">the-resouces</a> on GitHub; the creation of which required every LL staff member and fellow to get to know GitHub & Markdown. Whie this was largely a "state-of-emergency" endeavor, the output of workflows & habits it will create will help out the LL's projects even after coming back to the Studio!</p>
