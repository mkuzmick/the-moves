    <h1>Video Interactions App</h1>
    <h2>by Lauren, Sophie B, Phil, and reactLab, 2020 Spring</h2>
    <p>What started as conversations about a third reactLab tutorial & the possible applications of React in a classroom setting ultimately became <a href="https://github.com/1aurend/video-interactions">this</a> app, in which users could enter a Vimeo ID, generate that video, and leave comments on it that is sent to a Realtime Database, so the user can also view all past comments left on the video.</p>
