    <h1>First reactLab Tutorial</h1>
    <h2>by Lauren, 2019 Fall</h2>
    <p>Lauren wrote this <a href="https://github.com/learninglab-dev/ll-first-reactLab">tutorial</a> for the first day of reactLab. The goal of this tutorial was to create a React App where you could click on an image and it would switch to display a GIF, and vice versa. This tutorial was workshopped by various members of the LL and edited by Sophie B!</p>
