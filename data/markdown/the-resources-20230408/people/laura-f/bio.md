## Laura's Bio

This is a little bit about me. I have been a LLUF since October 2017, and I love it!

## Here are some of the tools I work with:
* Markdown!
* Photoshop
* Illustrator
* Spark
* But my main schtick has been TheatreLab curation
    * _This takes shape in working on innovative and creative ways to implement metrics of theater into the classroom space and how that can be useful for both instructors and students! For example:_
        *  Ensemble/group dynamics and the classroom
        *  Improvisation 
        *  Elements of theater space and stage design
        *  Immersive theater versus immersive learning
        *  Acting and empathy

## Here are some of the resources I have created:
* [A Storytelling Sparkpage](https://spark.adobe.com/page/A49LvcvvwLVnF/)
* [A tutorial doc for downloading Creative Cloud](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qvuVLlnTg36pnsbnQHrmN23wEH9zRHJ2IxOWa2AGlYI/edit)
* [A transcribed guide to all 50 Adobe Apps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c48dRRoZ019UUoevSGucE-BhH6SWbUl4DCJ9VP53nXM/edit)

The hardest thing to do is encapsulate in words exactly how meaningful the Learning Lab is to me. As a LLUF, a day in the life can look like anything I want it to, because I never quite know what exciting task or test will be assigned when I walk through the door. I am particularly interested in storytelling and aplicable, meaningful theater. I want to take all of the intangible, soft skills which I have learned from being in a theater space (discipline, flexibility, quick-thinking, empathy, and creativity, to name a few) and work to translate them into teachable qualities that can be implemented in a classroom space to create more productive, socially-engaged learners. I am most inspired by educators and finding ways to make their lives and students' lives better is what drives me. I love flexing my creative, problem-solving muscle and being presented with new challenges in the Learning Lab environment. I'm also excited that distanceLab has already offered numerous opportunities for me to expand my knowledge base to become more familiar with an even wider range of tools, from GitHub and MarkDown to Adobe Animator.
