### Learning Lab Bio

   The Learning Lab is a creative workshop focused on thoroughly generating a wide range of skills in order to best cultivate, express, and teach ideas to the public at large. My role is to serve as a labrat of sorts for the numerous projects developing at the lab. In addition to the plans spawned by fellow LLUFs, the lab receives the interests  of students at Harvard and creates personalized lesson plans to suit their needs. The work of the lab is essential in producing innovative education tools and expanding the thought process of learners worldwide.
