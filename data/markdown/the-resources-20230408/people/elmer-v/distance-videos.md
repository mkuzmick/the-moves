# Distance Lab Update Video(s)!

It has been a while since all of us, the LLUFs, have posted a video to our distance diaries. On the heels of our one-month reflections (which can now be found on [this lovely website](https://spark.adobe.com/page/8TWfFbQofOndK/)), this seems like a perfect time for all of us to post some video updates.

We have several ideas at the moment...

## Shorter Video(s)

### 1. Bok Friends 
Following one of the recent TikTok trends ([seen here](https://www.tiktok.com/@amandaseavers/video/6805981430582234374)), record yourself doing something random/ridiculous and then turn, realize the camera is there, and wave hello...**BUT**, with a Bok twist: 
	
The "random" thing you are doing should in some way connected to your current learning experience. In other words, perhaps find yourself doing readings in the shower, on a Zoom call while cooking, etc.

#### Video Protocol:

* Ensure that both your face and the action you are doing are clear in the video

### 2. What is Inspiring You?
Record (audio-only) yourself reading a quote that gets you motivated/inspired to do your schoolwork.

#### Audio Protocol:

* Since this is meant to be audio-only, you can follow the tips Casey has put together in [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeGq-5SYqXQ) for how to record a podcast
* You want to be physically close the microphone so that your voice is clear
* If possible, try to record yourself with minimal background noise

### 3. What's in your Fridge?
Following yet another recent TikTok trend ([seen here](https://www.tiktok.com/@calfreezy/video/6811885553479421189)), record yourself taking something random out of your fridge. The Bok twist: 

The "random" item you take out should reflect a tool that you have been using to do your Bok work, such as your laptop open to the Final Cut window, Photoshop, Illustrator, etc. (Note: Does not need to be a laptop).

#### Video Protocol:

* The goal is to see your entire face and upper body when you open the fridge and take something out, so try to set up your phone at upper-chest level
* Try to not be backlit, i.e. standing directly in front of a window, so that we can see your face clearly
* The video should start and end with the fridge door closed (we are trying to have smooth transition effects between all the clips)

## Longer Video

### 1. Reflection
Reflect and answer the following questions: How would you reflect on the purpose of learning? Has this idea changed for you since you have been learning online?

#### Video Protocol:

* Record yourself using your webcam or phone in the horizontal positioning (we want the video to be in landscape)
* Angle: If you use your webcam, then this angle works fine! If you are using your phone, place the phone at neck-level with a slight tilt up (just as if it were your laptop's webcam
* Positioning: Ideally, you are sitting upright and looking straight into the camera. Sit so that you your shoulders are visible and leave a 2-3 inches of empty space above your head as well. For an example of both what do to and what not do to, take a look at [this video from Trevor Noah's Daily Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3jiM2FNR8) - try to fill up the space like Trevor and not like Dr. Fauci (although Dr. Fauci is incredible!)
