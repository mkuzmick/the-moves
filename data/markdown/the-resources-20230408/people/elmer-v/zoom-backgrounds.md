# Zoom Backgrounds  
In my previous discussion on becoming a [Zoom pro](https://github.com/learninglab-dev/the-resources/blob/master/data/resources/people/elmer-v/zoom-pro.md), I mentioned that you could use a virtual background to help you feel more focused.

Ahead you will find a collection of wallpapers that you can use for this purpose, as well as some that simply make for a fun time.
