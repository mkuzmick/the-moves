## LL Bio
Hello! Although I've been a LLUF for less than a semester, the time I've spent with the Learning Lab has been incredible. 
The first time I walked into the Bok Center space, I remember my jaw dropping at the mere sight of all the vivid and colorful creations, perfectly placed cameras, and just the creative vibe in general.  
One of the best things about being a LLUF is that I get the chance to experiment with so many new tools and technology that I might never have had the chance to use. 
Recently, I've been diving into Adobe Apps like Photoshop, After Effects, and Illustrator. They have the ability to create and edit images, animations, and more.
Learning to use Adobe apps is fun, but it also has applications outside of just tinkering with pictures. For example, we can use this skills to create important projects, presentations, and products for work and school. 
I'm also thrilled to be learning Markdown, which I'm using to write this and which is great for anyone to easily create a website. It's beyond rewarding to both learn useful new tools and also use that knowledge to help ease the learning process for others. 
Outside of the Learning Lab, I enjoy running, writing poems, and dancing (or at least pretending like I can dance). I'm so excited to continue learning and making resources over the next few years as a LLUF!
