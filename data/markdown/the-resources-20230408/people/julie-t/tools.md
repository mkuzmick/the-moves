### Here are some helpful tutorial videos I've used to learn about tools on Photoshop, After Effects, and Illustrator.

#### Photoshop  
The best tutorial video for using...  
* **Adjustment layers** is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyJxmvRwWE&list=PLwLL9wHfI2zQWzYYpZxssOHaynd663F3q&index=24)
    because it's clear and concise (about 6 min long), while still giving in-depth and understandable explanations.
* **The clone stamp tool** is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mn38uUT7E0) because it's
    super comprehensive, explains everything in detail, and walks you through multiple examples.
    
#### After Effects  
The best tutorial video for using...  
 * **Keyframes** is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pX-GQjP4hA) because it's quick and to the point (about 4 min), 
    and it shows how to use keyframes with position, scale, and opacity.
* **The 3D camera tool** is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Axa38beTBvo) because it walks you through the process nicely
    and explains solutions to some problems you may encounter.  
  
#### Illustrator  
The best tutorial video for using...  
* **The stylize panel** is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXtOWViHW7Y) 
    because it walks you through using all of the effects on the stylize panel found under the effects dropdown menu.
    This is a longer video (about 15 min), so you might want to skip around to the parts you want.
* **The eyedropper tool** is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5wq2XWWtKE) 
    because it's quick (less than 4 min), but covers the main things you need to know.
