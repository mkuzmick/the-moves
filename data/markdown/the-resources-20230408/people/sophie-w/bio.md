### A Bit About Me:
Thanks for stopping by! I'm a junior in the resplendent Kirkland House studying Integrative Biology with a secondary in Earth & Planetary Sciences. I've been a LLUF since the start of my sophomore spring, and it has truly been such a rewarding experience and, without a doubt, the greatest job of all time! It has allowed me to be reflective on my academic experiences and get a better grasp on pedagogy while befriending and spending time with some amazing, hilarious, and unique folks.
