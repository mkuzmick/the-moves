## My LL Bio
#### What I'm learning in the LL and why
I came into the learning lab because I've always known I've wanted to teach and the opportunity to work on finding new, creative ways to support Harvard faculty in achieving their teaching goals sounded perfect for me. Little did I know, I would be doing a lot of learning and growing myself. When I started as a LLUF, I had never used any of the tools mentioned above.

A year at the LL later, everything I would normally explain on a whiteboard or on pencil and paper can now be expressed in so many different ways. If you're a visual learner, I can make animations on Aftereffects, if you're an auditory learner, I can edit podcasts in Garageband and create songs on the Ableton Push. I've learned that there is a world of ways to convey information and I get to use every new skill I learn in the LL to help teachers and students achieve their goals.
