# why I, abby mcelroy, love the learning lab :)

I applied to be a LLUF at the end of last semester, after the Learning Lab helped my expos class with our capstone projects. I fell in love with the color, creativity, and joy of the space, and I started working at the beginning of the winter semester. Since then, I have made puppets, worked on a loom, thought about ways to make distance learning more accessible, and even started to learn Markdown (see this page). I am so grateful for the Learning Lab, both as a place to work and as a place to learn. For a long time, I felt like every additional year of education asked me to be less creative and to subscribe to more rules and conventions. Here at the Learning Lab, they encourage us to use our imaginations and all of the technology available to us to learn and think in new and exciting ways. The Learning Lab is proof that higher ed can be filled with color AND academics :)
