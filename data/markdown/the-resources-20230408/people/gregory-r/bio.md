Hello hello, or, "meow meow" as Carole Baskin would say.

I'm one of the MPA's at the Learning Lab. I get my paws dirty with assisting the creation of exciting multimedia projects!

## So, Who Exactly Am I?

Some say I come from a long line of adorable felines. Others, argue that I'm just another one of your average Joe's. It's tough to get through the noise of 'fake news' these days so let me clear up some things.

I work part time for the Learning Lab and am a full-time grad student at Emerson College. I'm a semester away from earning my MFA in Film and Media Arts.

## What Am I Currently Working On?

Great question. As I mentioned, I'm a semester away from graduating from Emerson College. The culmination of the MFA program is a thesis film project. My thesis will consist of two parts.

**First**, is a 20 minute drama set in the former "Lumber Capital of the World" Aberdeen, Washington.

*"The Forgotten Corner"* follows a recent college grad, Sid Michaels, on a photo assignment to document the remnants of the former lumber and timber industry. What he discovers, is a thriving queer culture in a rural community. When one night he stumbles upon a drag show at a local watering hole.

**Second**, to compliment the film, I'm writing a 120 page novella. The thesis film picks up at chapter 3, after we've learned about the motivations and desires that lead Sid to Aberdeen. The drag show scene is important because this is where Sid meets Forrest Anderson. Forrest comes from a legacy baron family and for unknown reasons, he decides to become Sids local fixer. Shepherding him from Sawmills to Democratic Crab Fundraisers, while exploring the forgotten corners of the county and each other.



## Why Is This Story Important To Tell?

The films thematic elements is a blend of autobiographical experiences. The film explores themes from my life, as well as, some friends.  It's challenging, because all work is personal but not always directly autobiographical.

By developing the story with the additional council of close friends and locals in the community. I hope to add another layer, on top of the endless perspectives around:

- Sexual questioning
- Toxic masculinity
- Homophobia
- Love and belonging
