## How to collaborate within Premier Pro

In today's rapidly changing world, more and more people are wanting to collaborate on video projects. Knowing how to create efficient and effective workflows with multiple editors is a must know in post-production. The ability to manage projects, share assets, and keep everything organized in a collaborative team environment is an industry required skillset, but different people need to collaborate in different ways.

Rather than forcing a “right” way of doing things, Premiere Pro offers two separate workflows of collaborating.


## What are Team Projects?

Right off the bat, Team Projects is a more Cloud-focused approach. This is an ideal remote solution where editors are invited to collaborate on the Team Project. However, it's not a robust workflow for long-form projects like feature films.

Luckily, most of us work on smaller short-form projects where this Cloud solution excels. It's been noted that 22-minute episodic television workflows are manageable under Team Projects.

Shared Projects is a locally-focused solution. It allows impromptu sharing with existing projects, or more structured workflows with Master projects and shortcuts.

Think of the project files as "bins" containing master clips and sequences.

This workflow is stored on local-machines allowing offline access. This does require some robust shared storage that can handle multiple users over the network.
