## Step 1

The first step you'll need is to configure your Zoom settings to record. You can find a quick guide [here.](http://resources.learninglab.xyz/simple/people/katie-g/optimizing-zoom-recordings)

Once you've configured your recording options, [here](https://youtu.be/TtNkHi79FHw) is a quick guide on how to activate Zoom's recording function, as well as how you might use the screen share function to showcase any materials you'd like to include.

## Step 2

From here, you can just launch a Zoom meeting and hit the Record button on the control bar along the bottom. Once you've recorded it, you'll need to download that recording and trim away the excess footage. This is a quick process, you can find the instructions [here.](http://resources.learninglab.xyz/simple/people/mike-o/TrimmingVideo-Quicktime-Windows10)

## Step 3

Now that you have a neatly trimmed, pristine recording ready to be seen, all you need to do is upload it onto Canvas. There are many ways to do this, but [this one](http://resources.learninglab.xyz/simple/people/mike-o//CourseTrailer-Upload-to-YT) is simple and straight forward.
