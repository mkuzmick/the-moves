## My Bio
I am a first-year studying Applied Mathematics and Economics. I joined the Learning Lab because I wanted to explore my creative interests in a productive way. I love the idea of learning how to use new tools to help others learn them too. I have only been at the Learning Lab for about two months now, but they have been very productive. The things I have worked with include: photography, studio lighting, stop-motion animation, Final Cut Pro, Cinema 4D, Adobe Lightroom, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe After Effects. I chose to learn these tools because I find visual storytelling a quite rewarding and effective way to communicate ideas. In the future I hope to develop more coding skills because they give so much freedom in designing user experiences.
