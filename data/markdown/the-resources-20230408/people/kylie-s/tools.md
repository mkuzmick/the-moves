# Helpful Tools
In the process of learning how to use different tools in the Adobe Create Suite, I have stumbled across several great tutorials. The ones I have included are quite short and quick because I prefer to use tutorials to send me in the right direction and figure the rest out on my own. 

### Photoshop
* The best video I've found on creating masks is [this one](https://youtu.be/mqqVmGxvHaY) because it is very concise while still giving you enough information to feel confident trying it out on your own. 

### After Effects
* My favorite intro video on creating motion graphics is [this one](https://youtu.be/9bnOVV3EBC8) because it gives a really quick overview of some of the different things you can do in After Effects. It may not be the best for following along with becuase it is very fast paced, but you can pause it or just use it as an introduction to the many possibilities in this application.
