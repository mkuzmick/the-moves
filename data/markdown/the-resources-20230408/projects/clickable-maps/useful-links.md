# Creating Clickable Browser-Based Maps
a.k.a. getting maps to do stuff :)

## Examples

1. [https://www.270towin.com/](https://www.270towin.com/) US political map with outline highlights on hover

2. [https://interactivegeomaps.com/europe-map-with-html-tooltips/](https://interactivegeomaps.com/europe-map-with-html-tooltips/): Map with tooltips on hover

3. [https://population.io/#/1987/02/14/male/United%20States/expectancy](https://population.io/#/1987/02/14/male/United%20States/expectancy) Small sidbars that change on click

4. [https://tympanus.net/Development/Interactive3DMallMap/](https://tympanus.net/Development/Interactive3DMallMap/) Yes, it's a mall, but the bottom and side panes are a nice layout choice when lots of text accompanies the map

5. [https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/](https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/) A chrolopleth map seems like the way to go for political boundaries that highlight on hover

6. [https://react.rocks/tag/Map](https://react.rocks/tag/Map) Kanban of examples
