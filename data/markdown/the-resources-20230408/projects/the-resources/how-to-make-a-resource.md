#  HOW TO MAKE A RESOURCE

This short tutorial is going to walk you through the process of contributing a resource to **theResources**.

1. make sure you have a github account, and that you've been added to our development team (Slack us to join).
2. get to the repo [here](https://github.com/learninglab-dev/the-resources), and, more specifically, to the folder where all of our individual markdown files will go [right here](https://github.com/learninglab-dev/the-resources/tree/master/data/resources/people).
3. to create a new file in a new folder, click "Create new file" and type in both the folder and the file name: `folder/filename.md`.
4. copy and paste your markdown into the editor (or just type it there).
5. Under "Commit new file" type in a commit message ("Create my bio") along with any additional notes.
6. Leave "Create new branch" selected and type in a name for your branch (no spaces!).
7. Hit "Propose new file" to commit your changes to your new branch and submit a pull request.
8. Assign JK and MK as reviewers.
