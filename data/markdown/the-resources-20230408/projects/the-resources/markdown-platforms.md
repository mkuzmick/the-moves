# PROS AND CONS OF MARKDOWN PLATFORMS

## WHAT IS MARKDOWN?
Markdown is a markup language that allows you to change or add formatting on plain-text documents. Unlike a Word document, in which you can change text formatting at the click of a button, Markup requires users to denote desired formatting with special Markup syntax (ie. to make something bold, you have to place two asterisks on either side: **this would be bold in Markup**). Unlike languages like HTML, it's easy to read even before its rendered, so if the platform you're using doesn't include a real-time preview, it's still easy to work with! It is also highly versatile. People use Markup to create notes, books, websites, documents, and even emails! (It's also popular on Discord, Reddit and GitHub.) It's also platform independent â€” meaning that if you decide to change the Markdown platform you're using, you can change to another easily!
