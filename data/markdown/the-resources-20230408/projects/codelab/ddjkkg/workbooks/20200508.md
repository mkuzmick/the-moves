steps:
1. make sure you have [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed (if not, `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"`)
2. make sure you have git installed (if not, `brew install git`)
3. `brew install node`
4. `brew cask install atom`
5. `cd ~`, `mkdir Development`, `cd Development` to get into your Development folder
6. go to github and create a repository, copy the URL for cloning (not the address bar URL, but the one next to the green button)
7. `git clone [THE_URL_YOU_COPIED]` will create a new folder with the contents of your repistory
8. `cd [FOLDER_NAME]` gets you into your folder and `atom .` opens it up in Atom
9. `npx express-generator . --view=ejs` initializes your express project. `npm i` and the `npm start` gets the server started.
10. `npm i nodemon` and then adding`"devstart": "nodemon ./bin/www"` to your `package.json` and then `npm run devstart` in terminal will start up your server just like `npm start`, but `nodemon` will automatically restart the server every time you make a change, which will be more convenient for you.
11. learn about how `/bin/www` points to `/app.js` which points to `/routes/index.js` which receives requests from users and sends them back html by combining data (in the form of an object) and an `ejs` view.
