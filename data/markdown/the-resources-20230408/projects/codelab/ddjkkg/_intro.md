# THE DDJKKG CODING PROJECT

We'll use two folders (at least, but two for now) to organize the docs for this project.

In the [workbooks](/simple/projects/codelab/ddjkkg/workbooks) folder we'll store daily docs that each contain
* a list of what we accomplished "last time"
* a list of what we want to accomplish "this time"
* a wishlist of some of the stuff we want to accomplish "next time" (or in the more distant future)
* a notes space for code blocks and links and thoughts and anything else that seems relevant to the day's activities--some we can put in there before the session as prep, some we can add as we go.
Ultimately we can port some of this stuff over to more polished docs, which brings us to the need for the next folder . . .

In the [resources](/simple/projects/codelab/ddjkkg/workbooks) folder we'll have a more public (or potentially public) set of docs that would lead anyone through the various paths we've taken. This is intended to replace the [simple slack]() documentation, which is now 3 years old and out of date. But it can also be way way more modular than simple slack, enabling it to help out many different learners (and not just the "build a slack app" path). Potential clusters include
* setting up your development situation with by installing homebrew, git, node, and atom, creating a github account, and a first repository.
* initializing an npm project, both the `npm init` route and the `npm express-generator .` route.
* building a basic express app
* connecting to airtable to get data
* creating records on airtable
* creating a slack app
* using the canvas api

We can begin thinking about a workflow for getting documents from one folder to the other over time.
