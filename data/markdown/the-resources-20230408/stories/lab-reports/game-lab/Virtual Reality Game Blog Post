[5 Things a Virtual Reality Game Can Do For Your Online Classroom] (https://spark.adobe.com/page/ZkhXqYtGznLFG/)is a post authored 
by Ceci Mancuso with digital recordings by Clarisse Wells showcasing how sandbox MMOs could be a tool for small seminar online
classes. This post highlights the game [Rec Room] (https://recroom.com/). This game is designed as a place for friends to hangout
in VR together playing anything from paintball, dodgeball, escape rooms, and more. A key feature of the game is being able to 
create your own rooms to hangout in much like Google's [Game Builder] (https://www.blog.google/technology/area-120/create-3d-games-friends-no-experience-required/)
There are also template rooms that a player can launch as a restricted space only for them and their friends.

We saw potential in this game as an alternative classroom space to ZOOM. Key features are the following:
- the immersive feel to being in class with your friends
- the use of the digital white board 
- the in-game mic that turns on depending on how close each person is to each other in-game
- the breakout rooms in the Lounge space in particular
- the gestures feature that allows for handraising and other body language

There were some drawbacks, however, in that this beta version isn't available on MacOS and it seems to be buggy on the iPhone. The PC
version works great and the iPad version works decently enough. 

Another game we playtested and recorded [videos] (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RFygFLCQLZn8JiNsEGV2xoUh4To3lRtp)
for is called [VRChat] (https://vrchat.com/). We tested this before Rec Room and initially thought this game might be useful 
for online seminars. VRChat has a few good things going for it:
- VRChat is really immersive too as a 3D classroom experience
- It also has white boards, albiet, they aren't as intuitive as in Rec Room
- The in-game mic works the same
- Gestures allow for body language too in-game

There were some drawbacks, though. The two major ones were the default private room cap of 12 people meaning that if you had more 
than 11 students they couldn't all be in the same classroom. This could be fixed if you created your own world (called rooms in 
Rec Room), but in order to make your own room you need both a intermediate knowledge of level building in Unity 3D and enough play
hours in VRChat to upload the world you made to their server. Unlike in Rec Room, this isn't really friendly to anyone who doesn't
have a background or the time to build they own levels and makes it impossible to set up a private classroom quickly with the 
playtime requirement.
