# Unity Hero (Fall 2019)

[Unity Hero] (https://github.com/Omegaxinfinity/UnityHero) was a project inspired by Google's [Game Builder] (https://www.blog.google/technology/area-120/create-3d-games-friends-no-experience-required/).
The idea as to use a video game to teach someone new to Unity how to use Unity 3D.
The aesthetic of the game was a high fantasy RPG based very roughly on the art of Skyrim or Dragon Age. However, in the end
we went with a more cartoonish art style reminiscent of a Zelda title rather than the realism of those games. 

The intial idea was to use theories in game design around difficulty level and achievement to teach the following concepts:
- The basics of the 1st person controller
- Collision and triggers
- The Asset Store
- The foundation of coding in C#

While we debated whether or not to have a realistic screen of the Unity 3D Editor in the game for players to solve
challenges, we decided against it because the Editor is relatively easy to learn itself. What to do with it is the hard part,
and that was what we intended to show our players with Unity Hero.

The plan was to accomplish much of the above list via the use of villagers giving quest info or by exchanging dialogue with the player.
While Unity Hero is still incomplete, we were able to have a working village implemented where talking with the villagers
communicated the basics of the 1st person controller, collision, and a prototype of an Asset Store. We even added elements
about how to make an NPC or Enemy track player movements and information differentiating rigid bodies from colliders with respect
to how they react to the physics of the 3D world. 

Perhaps the most excited element of the game that we couldn't add that year was teaching the foundations of C# in Unity Hero.
We would have introduced a magic system in our game where the player character could cast spells altering the 3D world by 
completing code snippets.
